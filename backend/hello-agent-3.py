# Legacy LangChain-based agent implementation
# This file is kept for reference but is no longer used in the current application
# The active agent implementation is in agent.py

# TODO: This file can be safely removed as it's entirely commented out
# and the functionality has been replaced by the newer implementation in agent.py

#     # Print the response
